# Kubernetes

Welcome 👋🏻, this is an introductory guide to setting up and running Kubernetes locally for general testing, experimenting, or playing around with Kubernetes workflows.

## Overview

## Installation

Getting started with Kubernetes is really easy. There are a couple really versatile projects that allow for running Kubernetes quickly and easily. More projects are available, but to keep things simple, these two are common and cross platform.

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
    - Simplest way to get started
    - Toggle on the Docker Desktop Kubernetes in settings
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)
    - Very portable
    - Just requires Docker, but runs anywhere Docker can
    - More closely resembles cloud Kubernetes with built in tools and addons

## Setup

Both options have getting started guides:

- [Docker Desktop Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/)
- [Minikube Getting Started](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fmacos%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download#LoadBalancer)
